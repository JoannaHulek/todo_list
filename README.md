# TODO List Project

This project is my personal learning journey in complex web development. It's a simple TODO list application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm using this project to learn about front-end development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, styling with CSS, and more.

## Features

- **Adding Tasks:** Add new tasks to the list along with optional descriptions.
- **Task Description:** Each task can have an associated description.
- **Task Editing:** Edit task labels and descriptions.
- **Task Completion:** Mark tasks as completed with a checkbox.
- **Styling:** Basic CSS styling to improve the user interface.
- **Learning Purpose:** This project is primarily for learning complex web development processes.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the TODO list.
- **style.css:** The CSS file for styling the TODO list.
- **list.js:** The JavaScript file containing the logic for adding, editing, and completing tasks.
